# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze datasets of a MechaCar automobile prototype to predict average miles per gallon (MPG), summary statistics of suspension coil pounds per square inch (PSI), perform statistical analyses such as t-tests, and use the data interpret the findings and compare them against vehicles from other manufacturers.<br/>

## Results
### Linear Regression to Predict MPG


### Trip Analysis


### T-Tests on Suspension Coils


### Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
