# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze datasets of a MechaCar automobile prototype to predict average miles per gallon (MPG), summary statistics of suspension coil pounds per square inch (PSI), perform statistical analyses such as t-tests, and use the data interpret the findings and compare them against vehicles from other manufacturers.<br/>

## Results
### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
1. **Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?**</br>
*answer*

2. **Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?**</br>
*answer*

3. **Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?**</br>
*answer*

### Trip Analysis


### T-Tests on Suspension Coils


### Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
